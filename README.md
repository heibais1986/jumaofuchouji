A Story Inspired by a Heartbreaking Reality
==

This interactive narrative is inspired by the tragic true story of a 21-year-old Chinese gamer known online as "**Fat Cat**" (ËÉñÁå´). For two years, he poured his heart, soul, and over 510,000 yuan (approx. $70,000 USD) into a relationship, only to be met with betrayal. His story of immense sacrifice and the devastating ending resonated deeply across the internet, sparking widespread discussions about love, manipulation, and the value of self-worth.

While our story is a fictional work of fantasy and retribution, it is created as a tribute to that raw, unconditional love. We wanted to explore a world where such profound devotion doesn't just fade into tragedy but is reborn into a force of reckoning. This is a story of "what if"‚Äîwhat if he had a second chance, not as a human, but as something else, to reclaim his dignity and serve justice?

Synopsis
==

After sacrificing everything for the woman he loved, a young gamer named Lin Mo ends his life, only to be reborn as an orange cat named Yuanbao. With his human memories intact, he is adopted by a kind, wealthy woman and begins a new, luxurious life. But comfort cannot extinguish the burning fire of vengeance.

From the shadows, he meticulously plans his revenge against the woman who betrayed him. This is an interactive journey where your choices will determine the strategy, navigate the risks, and ultimately decide the fate of his quest for justice.
